# cert-manager configuration for agent certificates
# Prerequisites:
#   1. cert-manager must be installed in the cluster
#   2. The broker's CA issuer must be available (liqo-broker-ca-issuer)
#
# Note: The CA issuer is typically created in the broker cluster. For agents
# in separate clusters, you need to either:
#   a) Copy the CA Secret to the agent cluster and create a local issuer
#   b) Use a shared CA (e.g., Vault, external PKI)
#
# Usage:
#   kubectl apply -k config/certmanager/
